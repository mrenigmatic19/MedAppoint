# MedAppoint
Our proposed project aims to provide users with accurate details, contact information, and exact locations of hospitals to help them make quick decisions during medical emergencies. The platform is designed to address the problem of patients being shunted from one hospital to another due to a lack of ICU beds or treatment services.

In addition to providing real-time information on the availability of ICU beds, blood, oxygen, vaccinations, and syringes, our platform will also offer the feature of online booking of ICU beds and appointments of doctors for their regular checkups. Users can pay a bare minimum cost of their medical expenses and book the required services as well as ICU beds conveniently.

Our project also includes a feature that displays live data on active patients. This can help the government to conduct surveys and identify potential outbreaks of diseases. In case of abnormal increases in the number of cases of a particular disease, prompt action can be taken. By providing comprehensive information on the availability of critical medical supplies and services, our platform can help improve healthcare access and affordability while saving lives.
